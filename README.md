A new and simple way to display web pages

The goal is to display web pages in a simple html site side by side rather than linking to a new page using an anchor tag.

Pages can then be toggled using mouse-scroll or menu clicks.

This uses css measurement units VH and VW to accurately measure panels the exact height and width of the viewport.
